                    A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering
                    plants (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of
                    a
                    flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with
                    eggs.
                    Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a
                    population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower).
                </p>

                    Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and
                    are
                    the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as
                    to
                    cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower
                    develops into fruit containing seeds.
